Hi there!

My name's Laura, and I'm a psychologist and PhD candidate in Ethology at the Department of Ethology, ELTE, Budapest, Hungary. My current research explores the transformation of the relationships between humans and companion animals in modern society - an era marked by increasing loneliness, social alienation and changing family structures. For instance, I study how dog care is redefining the concepts of family and parenting in Western cultures. I'm also exploring the perceived costs and benefits of having a dog, and how they vary across Western and non-Western cultures.

Before starting this PhD program, I've studied psychology for 6 years, and worked in animal-assisted therapy for 2 years. During all these years, I've worked on various topics such as social representations, political attitudes, child social norm development, and the influence of emotions on pro-social behaviours. I've also taken introductory courses in anthropology and sociology - which I'm also passionate about.
